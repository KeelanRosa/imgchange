# imgchange.py

take a folder full of .jpg > sharpen > resize to 100x100 > save as .PNG

could probably stand a better name and more options but that's a problem for future me

# Use:
* save imgchange.py to computer
* run `python3 imgchange.py folder` where 'folder' is the folder full of jpgs you want converted to pngs

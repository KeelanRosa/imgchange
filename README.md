# imgchange.py

take a folder full of .jpg > sharpen > resize to 100x100 > save as .PNG

could probably stand a better name and more options but that's a problem for future me

# Requirements:
* Python 3 
  * easiest way to install on Windows 10 is by typing `Python` into command line/PowerShell and installing the Microsoft store result
* PIL
  * type `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip` into command line
  * type `python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow` into command line

# Use:
* save imgchange.py to computer
* in command line type `python3 imgchange.py folder` where 'folder' is the path name of the folder full of jpgs you want converted to png icons
